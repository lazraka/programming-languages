# programming-languages
 
This repository holds the projects for the Programming languages course in the UCLA Computer Science department. The course focused on concepts in design and use of programming languages, including abstraction, modularity, control mechanisms, types, declarations, syntax, and semantics. We explored several different language paradigms such as functional, object-oriented, and logic programming.
